🎉 Project: Global Layoffs Analysis Using SQL 🎉

Description: In this project, I analysed global layoff trends by leveraging SQL to clean and examine data sourced from Kaggle. The project is divided into two steps:

🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning

I began by focusing on thoroughly cleaning the dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Key tasks included:
•	Removing Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
•	Standardizing Data: Corrected spelling errors and standardized formats across the dataset.
•	Handling Missing Data: Removed records with blank values in critical fields to ensure completeness.
•	Fixing Data Types: Adjusted data types, converting text fields to the correct formats like dates and integers.
This careful cleaning process resulted in a dataset that was well-prepared for in-depth analysis.

💡 Step 2: Data Analysis

After preparing the dataset, I conducted a detailed analysis of global layoff trends using SQL. Key aspects of this analysis included:
•	Ranking Companies: Applied the DENSE_RANK function to identify which companies had the highest layoffs.
•	Trend Analysis: Discovered that 2023 saw the highest number of layoffs.
•	Company Comparisons: Compared layoffs among major companies like Tesla and Uber, identifying those with the most significant layoffs in recent years.
•	SQL Techniques: Utilized various SQL techniques including CTEs, CASE statements, GROUP BY, HAVING, Joins, and data aggregation functions.

📈 The insights gained from this analysis provide a clear understanding of how layoffs have impacted different industries and regions, offering valuable information for business decision-making.

  Outcome: This project demonstrates my ability to clean, prepare, and analyse complex datasets using SQL.
